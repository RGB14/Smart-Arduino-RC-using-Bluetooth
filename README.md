> Applications
<dl> 
<dt>1.	Wireless Communication</dt>
<dd>  -This device is based on the principle of wireless communication. In this case, Bluetooth is used. For better range, Wifi could have been used. But, due to the tight budget, Bluetooth was used. Most importantly, this is another form of DRONE. 
</dd>
<dt>2.	Various Project Dummy</dt>
<dd>  -This model can be used as a demo project for various vehicle manufacturers like Toyota. Such kind of project can be manipulated to express the desired the vehicular project. 
</dd>
<dt>3.	Toy Car</dt>
<dd>  -This can be used for recreational toy car, though it is expensive and not for children. Adults who are fascinated by vehicles and still have affection for vehicles can modify the model and create a customary option for their own needs. This is based on Arduino. So options are various.
